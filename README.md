# Reinforcement-Learning-The-Chess-Assignment

I include my code for the chess assignment in this repository.
You can find the code of 
                     DNN, Sarsa, and Q-Learning in the file "Q-Learning vs Sarsa";
                     Sarsa and running it in different values of beta in the file "sarsa_different_betavalues";
                     Sarsa and running it in different values of gamma in the file "sarsa_different_gammavalues";
                     Q-Learning and running it in different values of beta in the file "qlearning_different_betavalues";
                     Q-Learning and running it in different values of gamma in the file "qlearning_different_gammavalues";
                     
Thanks a lot for your revising.
